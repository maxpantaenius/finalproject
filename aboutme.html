    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <ul>
      <li>I am from <strong>Kansas City, Missouri</strong>, and I am a <strong>Senior</strong> at the <em><strong>University of Missouri</strong></em>.</li>
      <li>I love PC building and playing competitive video games. I built my first PC in 2020, and I am looking to upgrade soon!</li>
      <li>I am studying <em>Business Management</em> with a minor in <em>Entrepreneurship</em>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here is a link to my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxpantaenius/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
    <p>I am excited to learn more in this class and continue to apply my coding experience outside of class! Python has been my favorite coding language we have covered thus far, but I am looking forward to diving into other coding languages further.</p>
    <p>With enough practice, I hope to write my own program someday. Learning code is like learning any other spoken language; it requires repetition and determination.</p>
    <h5>Here is the Python code I wrote for the first assignment:</h5>
    <pre>
      <code>
print('Hello, my name is Max.')
print('I am a Senior at Mizzou studying business.')
print('I am from Kansas City.')
print('Lets go Chiefs!')
      </code>
    </pre>
